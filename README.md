# Keyboard Maestro Macros



## General Use Macros



## Modular Macros

These are not meant as standalone macros. They're to be kept in a collection called something like "Custom Actions" and then summoned in your other macros with the `Execute Macro` action.

### Set MouseLocation

This action sets a varialbe called "MouseLocation" to...the current mouse location.

Pair this with the `Use Variable` action with the option `to set the mouse location` option.
